The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n1  Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanuts...the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted. Not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as \"Jumbo\".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n2  This is a confection that has been around a few centuries.  It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' \"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch.  \n3  If you are looking for the secret ingredient in Robitussin I believe I have found it.  I got this in addition to the Root Beer Extract I ordered (which was good) and made some cherry soda.

Not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as \"Jumbo\".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n2   This is a confection that has been around a few centuries.  It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' \"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n3   If you are looking for the secret ingredient in Robitussin I believe I have found it.  I got this in addition to the Root Beer Extract I ordered (which was good) and made some cherry soda.  The flavor is very medicinal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n4   Great taffy at a great price.  There was a wide assortment of yummy taffy.  Delivery was very quick.  If your a taffy lover, this is a deal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n5   I got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag. The taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors: watermelon, root beer, melon, peppermint, grape, etc. My only complaint is there was a bit too much red/black licorice-flavored pieces (just not my particular favorites). Between me, my kids, and my husband, this lasted only two weeks! I would recommend this brand of taffy -- it was a delightful treat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n6   This saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy.  Each candy was individually wrapped well.  None of the candies were stuck together, which did happen in the expensive version, Fralinger's.  Would highly recommend this candy!  I served it at a beach-themed party and everyone loved it!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n7   This taffy is so good.

When we realized that we simply couldn't find it anywhere in our city we were bummed.<br /><br />Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it.<br /><br />If you love hot sauce..I mean really love hot sauce, but don't want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat, grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan.  Just realize that once you taste it, you will never want to use any other sauce.<br /><br />Thank you for the personal, incredible service!   \n11  One of my boys needed to lose some weight and the other didn't.

I was home bound and unable to get to a store so this was perfect for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n20  My husband is a Twizzlers addict.  We've bought these many times from Amazon because we're government employees living overseas and can't get them in the country we are assigned to.  They've always been fresh and tasty, packed well and arrive in a timely manner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n21  I bought these for my husband who is currently overseas. He loves these, and apparently his staff likes them also.<br />There are generous amounts of Twizzlers in each 16-ounce bag, and this was well worth the price. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVISJM\">Twizzlers, Strawberry, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n22  I can remember buying this candy as a kid and the quality hasn't dropped in all these years.

When I go back to visit or someone visits me, I always stock up.  All I can say is YUM!<br />Sell these in Mexico and you will have a faithful buyer, more often than I'm able to buy them right now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n25  Product received is as advertised.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVISJM\">Twizzlers, Strawberry, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n26  The candy is just red , No flavor .

We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away!  When we realized that we simply couldn't find it anywhere in our city we were bummed.<br /><br />Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it.<br /><br />If you love hot sauce..I mean really love hot sauce, but don't want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat, grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan.  Just realize that once you taste it, you will never want to use any other sauce.<br /><br />Thank you for the personal, incredible service!   \n\n    Topic  \n0   2      \n1   4      \n2   0      \n3   3      \n4   4      \n5   3      \n6   4      \n7   4      \n8   2      \n9   2      \n10  4      \n11  2      \n12  2      \n13  4      \n14  0      \n15  4      \n16  4      \n17  4      \n18  3      \n19  4      \n20  4      \n21  1      \n22  4      \n23  0      \n24  4      \n25  1      \n26  4      \n27  4      \n28  0      \n29  4      ",
